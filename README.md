# Democratic thoughts

A collection of silly, provocative, wrong and fun ideas that people tell me.


The biggest problem of capitalism is a misalignment problem. In other words, the biggest problem is how it distorts the notion of value. I will give two examples:
- Capitalists are not incentivized to create tech for the poorest people because these people don't have money to pay for that tech. This means that very creative technological solutions for the problems of the less privileged receive no economically-motivated effort. 
- Capitalists are not incentivized to develop cheaper solutions. For instance, imagine a big pharma company that has proprietary ways to develop new drugs. This company has no economic incentives to use that proprietary technology to develop the drug with the lowest dosage required, quite the opposite.
