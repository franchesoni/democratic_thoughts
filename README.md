# Democratic thoughts
A collection of silly, provocative, wrong and fun ideas that people tell me.

The biggest problem of capitalism is a misalignment problem. In other words, the biggest problem is how it distorts the notion of value. I will give two examples:
- Capitalists are not incentivized to create tech for the poorest people because these people don't have money to pay for that tech. This means that very creative technological solutions for the problems of the less privileged receive no economically-motivated effort. 
- Capitalists are not incentivized to develop cheaper solutions. For instance, imagine a big pharma company that has proprietary ways to develop new drugs. This company has no economic incentives to use that proprietary technology to develop the drug with the lowest dosage required, quite the opposite.


There are many potential solutions that I could write about in my current state (just got home from a bar). In particular:

- Negative income tax: people should be given money so they can have a life but they should always prefer to earn more (in the sense that earning less couldn't be financially adventageous). Negative income tax is better than universal basic income because it acutally promotes earning more without forgetting the fact that rich people need to be taxed and the poor subsidized. What is a system with UBI and taxes if not a system with negative income tax?
- There should be a centralized value chart, to be defined democratically, that enables the state to use the same negative income tax principle for activities in many companies, basically incentivizing good behavior.
- the state should be in an app
- all data should be colelcted and carefullyh saved (no-one should be able to access the data).
