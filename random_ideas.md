Things that could be cool to have, ideas that are different and interesting, etc.

- don't get knocked out: people don't really understand the price of getting knocked out
- the church did a great job: if the fear of punishment is the best way to make humans behave but the punishment is not desirable because we don't want people to suffer, we need to have the fear but not the punishment. This is exactly what the idea of the inferno was. 
- there should be a service that helps people deal with bureaucracy
